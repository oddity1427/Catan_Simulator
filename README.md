# Catan_Simulator

The end goal of this project is to build a Catan program that is playable by humans but also by programmable ai.
I want to use c++ knowledge to build a framework that I can test machine learning concepts on, as well as to test strategies that I think up.
As a result of this the visual aspects will be minimal, however the game should eventually be fully functional.
I am going to start out building the framework of the board and other elements to the game and later work towards making it more fully featured.
